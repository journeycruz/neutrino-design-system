# Harvest Operation

Harvest converts temporary session notes into permanent, scannable context. Keep output minimal and reusable by future tasks.

## Key Points
- Read source summaries and task artifacts first.
- Extract only durable learnings and concrete next steps.
- Write outputs into function folders: `concepts/`, `guides/`, `lookup/`, `examples/`, `errors/`.
- Keep each file below 200 lines and MVI-focused.
- Never delete or archive without explicit letter-based approval UI.

## Minimal Example
```md
Source: .tmp/session.md
Target: .opencode/context/domain/feature/concepts/learnings.md
Output: 1-3 sentence concept + 3-5 bullets + link
```
