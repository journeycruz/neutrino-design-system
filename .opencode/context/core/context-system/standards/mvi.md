# MVI Standard

Minimal Viable Information keeps context compact and useful. Prefer high-signal summaries over exhaustive prose.

## Key Points
- Core concept: 1-3 sentences.
- Key points: 3-5 bullets.
- Minimal example: under 10 lines.
- Include one reference link for deeper detail.
- Keep every file under 200 lines.

## Minimal Example
```md
Concept: Tokens separate primitives and semantics for reuse.
Points: Naming, aliasing, theming, build output.
Example: token JSON snippet.
Link: spec URL.
```
