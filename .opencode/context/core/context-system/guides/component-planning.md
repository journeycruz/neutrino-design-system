# Component Planning Guide

Plan production readiness in small, verifiable phases.

## Key Points
- Start with foundations (token pipeline, themes, docs contracts).
- Implement one capability at a time and validate after each step.
- Prefer additive changes that do not break package exports.
- Record release impact and migration notes for each phase.

## Minimal Example
```txt
Phase 1: Tokens + themes
Phase 2: APG behavior depth
Phase 3: Visual regression governance
```
