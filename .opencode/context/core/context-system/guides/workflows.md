# Workflow Guide

Use a predictable flow so context updates stay safe and consistent. Discover, load standards, extract, then optionally clean up with approval.

## Key Points
- Discover sources and required standards files.
- Load operation guide + MVI standard before writing outputs.
- Write function-structured context files with concise content.
- Validate size/structure before declaring completion.
- If cleanup is needed, present letter-based approval choices first.

## Minimal Example
```txt
1) Discover sources
2) Load standards
3) Write concepts/guides/lookup/examples/errors
4) Validate
5) Ask cleanup approval (A/B/C/all)
```
